This is one of the dialogues of Tyrion Lannister
Drinking and lust. No man can match me in these things.  
I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit.

Another one of Tyrion's dialogue:
Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. 
Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.
